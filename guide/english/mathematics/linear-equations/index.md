## Linear Equations

Any equation that can be written in the form **Ax+Bx=0**

* where _'A'_ and _'B'_ represent real numbers
* _'x'_ represents a variable

is referred to as a linear equation.

A linear equation is an equation for a straight line. The variables in  linear equations *do not* contain exponents, or square or cube roots. 

There are several different forms a linear equation can take including:

#### Slope-Intercept Form

**y = mx + b**

* _'y'_ is the y-coordinates on the slope
* _'mx'_ is the slope, or rate of which the equation is headed. This can be calculated using **(y2-y1/x2-x1)**, where the numerator is the vertical shift, while the denominator is the horizontal shift.
* _'b'_ is the y-intercept, or where the linear function meets the y-axis.

#### Point-Slope Form

**(y-y1) = m(x-x1)**

* where _'(x1, y1)'_ is a known point on the line
* _'m'_ is the slope of the line
* _'(x,y)'_ is any other point on the line that we want to find



#### General or 'Standard' Form

**Ax+By+C=0**

* where _'A'_, _'B'_ and _'C'_ are real numbers
* where _'A'_ and _'B'_ can be zero but not at the same time



#### Function

Linear equations can be written as a function where _'f(X)'_ replaces _'y'_

*e.g.* **y = 2x-3** becomes **f(x) = 2x-3**

 
 
 #### Identity Function
 
**id(x) = x**

An identity equation is a special kind of linear equation. An identity function assigns every real number to the same real number.

#### Constant Function

A constant function is a function whose output is the same for every input value
